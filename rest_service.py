Problem 2

Write a short Python script to connect to the REST service
located at: https://news.google.com/news/rss/?ned=us&amp;hl=en

This problem is intended to show how you interact with a REST api.
Script will take as input a date time string that accepts the date and time in the following

format â€“ 2016/Mar/08 14:12:24

Output will be news titles with the Top Stories category that have been posted after the input time stamp.

Example output:
US Military Sending Warship to Israel, Spy Planes to Syria After Chemical
Weapons Report
Trump reportedly unclear on difference between Medicare and Medicaid
